           <h1>Buckingham Palace</h1>
           <p>Of course, we can't forget about Buckingham Palace — the official residence of the British Royal Family. This iconic building has a rich and fascinating history. Although many people think of it as a castle, Buckingham Palace was originally built as a townhouse in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham. It became a royal residence in 1837 when Queen Victoria moved in.</p>
           <br>
           <p>The palace has faced damage several times throughout history. One notable event occurred during the Second World War, on September 13, 1940, when it was bombed and partially destroyed. Despite this, the palace has been restored and remains a symbol of the British monarchy. Today, King Charles the third resides at Buckingham Palace. The building is enormous, with five floors. It includes 19 state rooms used for official events, 52 royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms.</p>
           <br>
           <p>Visitors can take guided tours of parts of the palace during certain times of the year. You can also witness the famous Changing of the Guard outside. And if you're lucky, you might even spot a member of the Royal Family!</p>
